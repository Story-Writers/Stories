<h1>Discord Wars Chapter 1:The Raid</h1>
<p>This world it like yours, but different in many ways. Uhh... why am I writing that? Stupid me. Anyway, just go on and read about what I'm writing.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.8vw">Stupid me, shouldn't written this in non-erasable pen.</p>
<p>This is the document of the legendary war between the Hacking Gamers! and the Crackpots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I was chatting to my friend, Heloise about stuff while training at the Aim Gym nearby Hacking Gamers. We were doing the standard warmups and stuff. We are super competive when it comes to our aim, so we go SUPER in the zone when we are doing some competive aim challenges, so we nearly didn't hear the giant noise from Hacking Gamers!</p>
<p>The exclamation mark was not for punctuation, the founders named it that way ok.</p>
<p>Anyway, we rushed inside, looking around for people starting it, the raid, not the founders.</p>
<p>I looked around and saw Accelerator bot sitting ratlimted on the bench next to the cafe.</p>
<p>"The people that started this raid ratelimted Accelerator to stop the AutoMod from banning them," Helosie said.</p>
<p>"I know," I said looking around to see Dyno, the other moderation bot that I could use to mute everybody.</p>
<p>"Uhh... Happpy, is that your embed webhook yelling at everybody?" Heloise asked me, pointing.</p>
<p>I looked towards where Heloise was pointing and saw my embed webhook (a intergration I use to send embed messages) I deleted the embed webhook yelling at everybody and yelled "DYNO, MUTE ALL MEMBERS NOW!". Everybody immediately got muted beside all the staff. "EVERYBODY STAGE 1 NOW!!!"</p>
